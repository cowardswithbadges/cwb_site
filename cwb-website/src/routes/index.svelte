		<h1>what defuning police means.</h1>

			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
			classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
			Latin professor at <a href="/">Hampden-Sydney</a> College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
			words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
			classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
			1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
			Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
			the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
			line in section 1.10.32.

			There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
			alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
			slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure
			there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators
			on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
			generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a
			handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
			generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
			non-characteristic words etc.
