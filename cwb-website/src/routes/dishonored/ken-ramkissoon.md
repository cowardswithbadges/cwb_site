PBM Police Incident Reoort: DeLand, FL - A former DeLand police officer who was fired is suing the city for wrongful termination.

#### A "good cop" is fired for reporting another officer.

Allison Bainbridge's lawsuit claims she was dismissed for filing a complaint against one of her superiors, Ken Ramkissoon, for the way he treated a homeless man. That superior was eventually demoted and briefly suspended without pay after an internal investigation. A month before that happened, though, the DeLand Police Department fired Bainbridge, claiming her performance didn't meet department standards.

Bainbridge is seeking more than $15,000 in damages for civil rights violations under the Florida Public Sector Whistleblower's Act, according to paperwork filed with the Volusia County Clerk of Courts. She's also seeking compensation for lost wages and benefits.
