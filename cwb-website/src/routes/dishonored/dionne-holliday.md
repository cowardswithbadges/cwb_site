MCPD said they received a call for service at the elementary school on Jan. 14 in regards to a 5-year-old student who had left the school grounds and "did not wish to return" 

Two MCPD officers, Dionne Holliday and [Kevin Christmon](/dishonored/kevin-christmon) responded to the call for service.

#### Dionne Holliday arrests a five year old boy.

The officers confronted the boy less than a quarter-mile from the school. They were immediately stern with the child, according to a body camera video released of the incident in 2020, and become increasingly aggressive as the boy gets more upset.

Christmon grabs the boy’s arm and escorts him into a police car. Christmon drives the boy and then - Assistant Principal Justine Pfeiffer, who was present throughout, back to the school.

Within the body camera video, Kevin Christmon can be heard yelling at the student, calling the child a "violent little thing," a "little beast," and "bad."  Kevin Christmon is also seen grabbing the student by the arm, threatening to beat the child, and handcuffing the child.  

Just a little past the 13 minute mark, the male officer is heard saying that they received a call for a dispute involving a 5-year-old and that he had walked out of the school not wanting to come back even after a staff member followed him to try and get him back in.

Then fast forward to the 30 minute mark and the officers are heard discussing with the mother, what the child did at the school including hitting teachers and other students, breaking a $1,000 computer, throwing an eraser before he walked off property.

#### Child Abuse

When he is seated, Holliday is shown letting out five screams inches from the boy’s face, mocking the 5-year-old’s cries.  "I need to beat on somebody," she then said, one of several references the officers made to "beating" children or the boy.

After the boy's mother arrives, the officers bring them both into a conference room. After a brief conversation in which they tell the mother she can legally "beat" the child, an officer places one handcuff around the boy's wrist and puts both of the boy's hands behind his back.

While the officers continue to harass the child, Dionne Holliday can be heard demanding that the student stop crying and screaming in the student's face.  She also tells the child "Does your mama spank you? Does your mama spank you? She’s going to spank you today."

The incident sparked intense criticism of county police, leaders and the school district, coming from around the world.

The family filed a lawsuit in January 2021 against the officers and MCPS for assault and battery, false arrest, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional arrest. The lawsuit also included violations of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and negligence against the Montgomery County school board.

Several speakers, including U.S. Reps. Jamie Raskin and Anthony Brown — reflected on their initial reaction to the video.

Brown said it brought him to tears. Raskin called it "horrifying."

#### Government Bullies

"We have grownups bullying a child and agents of the government who are supposed to be on the side of rule of law and of the people bullying a little kid," Raskin said. "That's what’s so heartbreaking about the whole thing."

After an internal investigation, both officers involved remain employed. The department has said that the officers faced discipline, but has declined to say what it was.

Justine Pfeiffer was placed on administrative leave by MCPS briefly, then assigned to another school. Within weeks, she was reassigned to a position in the school district’s central office after pushback from the new school community.

The county government in November passed a new law, inspired by the incident, that requires all Montgomery County police officers in uniform or when displaying a badge or insignia to wear body cameras.

It also requires the county police department’s Internal Affairs Division to review any body camera footage and report to the police chief any case related to the use of force, involving children younger than 18, a potential criminal offense, a fatality or serious injury.
