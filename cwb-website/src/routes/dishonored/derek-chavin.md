Derek Michael Chauvin is an American former police officer who was convicted for the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Chauvin was a member of the MPD from 2001 to 2020 and graduated from Metropolitan State University in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in law enforcement.

#### The murder of George Floyd

For 8 minutes and 46 seconds, George Floyd was pinned to the ground with Derek Chauvin's knee on his neck.

Chauvin was charged with second-degree and third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. Former officers Lane, Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. All four officers were fired.

On July 13, a coalition of media companies filed a motion to obtain copies of the body camera video. Two days later, reporters were allowed to view the footage by appointment but not take it with them. A hearing was held July 21, and neither the state nor the defense objected to the footage being released to the media. On Friday, Aug. 7, Judge Peter Cahill filed an order releasing the video to media and members of the public who want to obtain copies. That video was ultimately made public on Aug. 10.
