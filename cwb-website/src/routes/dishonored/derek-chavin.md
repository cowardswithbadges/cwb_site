On July 13, a coalition of media companies filed a motion to obtain copies of the body camera video. Two days later, reporters were allowed to view the footage by appointment but not take it with them. A hearing was held July 21, and neither the state nor the defense objected to the footage being released to the media. On Friday, Aug. 7, Judge Peter Cahill filed an order releasing the video to media and members of the public who want to obtain copies. That video was ultimately made public on Aug. 10.
