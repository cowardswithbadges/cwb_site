The body cam video shows Sunrise Tyrant Christopher Pullease threatening the suspect with pepper spray, engaging in a verbal altercation with him after he'd already been taken into custody and placed in the back of a patrol car.  This is proof that Christopher Pullease doesn't know when to stop.

After a 28-year-old female officer grabs Pullease by the back of his belt and tries to pull him away, he turns around and puts *his hand around her throat*, before grabbing her by the vest and pushing her against another patrol car. Pullease then returns to the patrol car where the suspect is detained, opening and closing the door, before pointing his finger at the female officer and walking away.

The other police officers on the scene did nothing to stop this tyrant and defend the female officer.

#### Christopher Pullease is a Tyrant

The 46-year-old Pullease, a 21-year veteran of the force, and wife beater was assigned to desk duty on November 25th after the department launched an internal affairs investigation of the incident. In an interview with Miami's Channel 7, Sunrise Police Chief Anthony Rosa said Pullease's behavior was *"disgusting,"* adding that * "the video speaks for itself.” *   Calling Pullease's actions toward the suspect "inappropriate and unprofessional," Rosa commended the female officer, who has been on the force for only two-and-a-half years, for her efforts to de-escalate. “I’m very proud of this police officer," Rosa said. "She took some definitive action. I can only imagine what she must be feeling. She’s a newer officer, and he’s a very senior sergeant.”

The department muted the audio and blurred the faces of those shown the video with the exception of Christopher Pullease. The officer he assaulted has not been identified.


#### why isn't Christopher Pullease in jail?

Asked why Pullease isn't facing criminal charges, Rosa said: “So there’s some details of the investigation that I’ve not disclosed, that I’m unable to disclose right now, and if any of the information that comes up during the investigation rises to a level of criminal behavior or criminal conduct, then we’ll address it appropriately.”

Pullease had been cleared of two previous of excessive force incidents.

Vice News notes that most police departments "have a policy that requires officers to intervene if a fellow cop is taking things too far with someone they’re interacting with.  "But the institution is often criticized for not following through," the site reported. "As George Floyd was being murdered, for example, none of the three officers present chose to physically stop officer Derek Chauvin from kneeling on the Black man’s neck for more than nine minutes. This failure to act is the subject of both a federal and state criminal trial scheduled to begin later this year."

#### Commissioner Joseph A. Scuotto is a tyrant and a racist

In a Sunrise Commission Meeting, Joseph A. Scuotto defended Christopher Pullease's assault on the female police officer.

In the words of Commissioner Mark Douglas:

"In Scuotto's display of ignorance he is prepared to accuse everyone else of spinning the story, but as a leader of the community, it was not important enough to watch the video by his own admission.  *It is never ever OK*, to refer to another human, a member of our community or someone in our police custody as a 'piece of shit.' But as usual, after 25 years as a commissioner in our city, who elected its first minority in 2016 after 56 years, Scuotto is trying to hang on to the good old boy mentality of seeing no evil, hearing no evil, and defending the indefensible at all cost as long as it involves 'certain' people for whom he has nothing but contempt."

In the past, Joseph Scuotto has also shown his anger and controlling problems in other meetings.  For more on this tyrant, see our story on [Joseph Scuotto](/dishonored/joseph-scuotto).
