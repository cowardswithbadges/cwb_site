First Amendment audits are a largely American social movement that usually involves photographing or filming from a public space. The practice of exercising one's constitutional right to record video for the purpose of educating anyone who attempts to infringe that right and commending those who respect it.

#### what is the first amendment?

First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: 

> * Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

#### transparency and open government

Justice Jacques Wiener of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit wrote in a 2017 federal appeals decision in favor of an auditor detained for filming police officers, 

> * “Filming the police contributes to the public’s ability to hold the police accountable, ensure that police officers are not abusing their power, and make informed decisions about police policy.”

Auditors tend to film or photograph government buildings, equipment, access control points and sensitive areas, as well as recording law enforcement or military personnel present. Auditors have been detained, arrested, assaulted, had camera equipment confiscated, weapons aimed at them, had their homes raided by a SWAT team, and been shot for video recording in a public place. 

Such events have prompted police officials to release information on the proper methods of handling such an activity. For example, a document sponsored by the International Association of Chiefs of Police states that the use of a recording device alone is not grounds for arrest, unless other laws are violated.

Auditors are concerned that if officers are willing to harass, detain, and arrest auditors, who intentionally avoid doing anything that might be considered a crime, normal citizens might shy away from recording officers for fear of retaliation. 


#### law enforcement officers don't know the publics' rights and amendments.

Law enforcement agencies all over America have sent memos, emails, and have officers train in basic knowledge of the first amendment and the rights of citizens.  Law Enforcement is in a sad state when emails have to be sent to officers telling them to "Uphold the general rights of the public".

Jim Kiertner, a reporter from WXYZ-TV Detroit, Channel 7 News, made an extremely bias report in favor of police violating the general rights of the public, including the First Amendment.  It's hilarious and sad to hear at the same time, a white reporter, make fun of First Amendment Auditors, who are actively defending the freedom of the press.   First Amendment Auditors are real journalism exposing bad practices in Law Enforcement and Jim Kiertner attempts to paint a bad picture.  The ability to feel shame for Law Enforcement [not knowing civilian rights and laws](/resources/officers-donot-have-to-know-law) requires self awareness... which Jim Kiertner and the rest of WXYZ-TV Detroit lack.
