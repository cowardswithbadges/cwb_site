First Amendment audits are a largely American social movement that usually involves photographing or filming from a public space. The practice of exercising one's constitutional right to record video for the purpose of educating anyone who attempts to infringe that right and commending those who respect it.

#### what is the first amendment?

First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: 

> * Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

#### transparency and open government

Justice Jacques Wiener of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit wrote in a 2017 federal appeals decision in favor of an auditor detained for filming police officers, 

> * “Filming the police contributes to the public’s ability to hold the police accountable, ensure that police officers are not abusing their power, and make informed decisions about police policy.”

Auditors tend to film or photograph government buildings, equipment, access control points and sensitive areas, as well as recording law enforcement or military personnel present. Auditors have been detained, arrested, assaulted, had camera equipment confiscated, weapons aimed at them, had their homes raided by a SWAT team, and been shot for video recording in a public place. 

The audits, often posted to YouTube, have become a form of activism: individuals stake out a public facility and record the location and any interactions with staff and the public. An uneventful audit is akin to “passing a test,” while a confrontational audit, usually an attempt by an employee to interfere with the filming, gets a failing grade. Many audits are non-violent and uneventful. But some encounters have escalated dramatically, resulting in arrest and litigation.

Such events have prompted police officials to release information on the proper methods of handling such an activity. For example, a document sponsored by the International Association of Chiefs of Police states that the use of a recording device alone is not grounds for arrest, unless other laws are violated.

Auditors are concerned that if officers are willing to harass, detain, and arrest auditors, who intentionally avoid doing anything that might be considered a crime, normal citizens might shy away from recording officers for fear of retaliation. 


#### law enforcement officers don't know the publics' rights and amendments.

Law enforcement agencies all over America have sent memos, emails, and have officers train in basic knowledge of the first amendment and the rights of citizens.  Law Enforcement is in a sad state when emails have to be sent to officers telling them to "Uphold the general rights of the public".

Unfortunately, officers are discouraged from learning the laws due to the case of Heien v. North Carolina.  The court created a mistake of law defense based upon an [officer's ignorance of the law](/resources/officers-donot-have-to-know-law), which carved out a new exception to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.


#### why do Auditors claim they are media and sell merchandise?

The first amendment covers free speech.  With more smart phones being available to everyone, video content can easily be created and consumed.  Anyone can be an independent media source: from a film maker to an independent journalist, and many other roles that require knowledge in videography, editing, and audio.  

While giant media companies sell advertisements to keep their station running, small media sources, similar to first amendment auditors sell merchandise to pay for their recording equipment, cover website hosting fees, and other subscription services.

#### Can failing an Audit bring lawsuits?

In a short answer, yes.  If you're constitutional rights were violated, you have the right to start a lawsuit.  Many lawsuits have been filed all over the United States.  On May 31, 2018, the City of Colorado Springs settled with videographer for $41,000.

An auditor from Colorado photographed and filmed marked police cars in parking lot at a police substation. The police officers thought he was acting suspiciously and asked for identification, which he declined to provide. The officers detained him and took away his camera and cell phone. The auditor filed a complaint agains the officers for wrongful detainment, which the city eventually settled for $41,000.

There are many other lawsuits that have been paid out or in progress.  A great resource for newsworthy audits, how to become an audior/teacher are available at [First Amendment Water](https://firstamendmentwatch.org/teaching-the-first-amendment/).
