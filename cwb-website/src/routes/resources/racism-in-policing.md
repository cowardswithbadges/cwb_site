#### How did the policing system in america become racist?

The U.S. policing system has been racist since its inception during the slavery era. The first municipal police department in the country was in Charleston, South Carolina, and it was conceived as a slave patrol to monitor and surveil the Black enslaved population and prevent them from planning any resistance efforts to achieve freedom. In the same state, a riot by enslaved people in 1639 led to the passage of a law requiring enslaved people be kept in “due subjugation and obedience.”

North Carolina Slave Patrol Oath:

> * "I [patroller's name], do swear, that I will as searcher for guns, swords, and other weapons among the slaves in my district, faithfully, and as privately as I can, discharge the trust reposed in me as the law directs, to the best of my power. So help me, God."

In Virginia, Legislators passed a law removing felony penalties for the murder of enslaved people who resist masters. Laws like these may not be on the books anymore, but they are still in effect when it comes to policing Black communities — from the way in which policing operates as an occupying force in these communities to the legal barriers against holding police accountable when they kill community members.

Police brutality and the resulting protests recurred throughout the 20th century. Again and again, commissions convened to examine why police brutality sparks unrest have come to the same conclusion: We must address the poverty and systemic racism that go hand in hand with policing communities of color.

#### How Deep does the racism go?

According to a [2020 narrative criminology article](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/978-1-78769-005-920191028/full/html?skipTracking=true) tracing the history of the [thin blue line flag](/resources/what-does-thin-blue-line-mean) by Maurice Chammah and Cary Aspinwall of the Marshall Project, the idea of a thin blue line was first used to describe police in the United States in the 1920s and was popularized in the 1950s by Los Angeles Police Chief William H. Parker. 

Parker was notorious for making racist remarks. The origin of the thin blue line as a concept lies in the idea that the police separate ordered society from the chaos of a criminal element, and the idea was popularized by a police chief who was overtly racist. It would be naïve to assert that Parker’s racism and his promotion of a policing philosophy that divides society into an “us” deserving protection and a “them” that does not, are unconnected.

Dr. Brian Kingshott wrote [Police Culture, Ethics and Entitlement Theory](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/police_entitlement_theory.pdf), a research article where police culture is described as isolationist, elitist, misogynist, racist, and authoritarian. Dr. Kingshott suggests that these cultural descriptions stem from everyday interactions of the police with their various environments and the people they meet in those environments. 

Those environments include other agencies, (medical response teams, courts, lawyers, probation, social services, employment
agencies, customs, corrections, immigration, etc.), accident and crime scenes, victims home and work place, the organizations managers and day to day social intercourse
with the general public.

People of color are judged more harshly for crimes they commit.  The United States Sentencing Commission released a report on [Demographic Differences in Sentencing](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/sentence_demographics.pdf) and one of the key findings is black male offenders continued to receive longer sentences than similarly situated White male offenders.

#### Does the criminal justice system do anything to help?

Far from offering people a "second chance," the American criminal justice system frequently punishes those who never had a first chance: people in poverty. By focusing law enforcement on low-level offenses and subjecting criminal defendants to money bail and other fees, this country effectively punishes people for being poor.

Poverty is not only a predictor of involvement with the justice system: Too often, it is also the outcome. Criminal punishment subjects people to countless fines, fees, and other costs (often enriching private companies in the process). A criminal record, meanwhile, does lasting collateral damage.
