The "thin blue line" is a term that typically refers to the concept of the police as the line which keeps society from descending into violent chaos.  The "blue" color in "thin blue line" refers to the blue color of the uniforms of many police departments.  

#### Thin Blue Line has ties in racism

The thin blue line flag is a problematic symbol connected to [racist bigotry](/resources/what-does-acab-mean) and support for the use of state violence against racial minorities in the United States.

According to a [2020 narrative criminology article](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/978-1-78769-005-920191028/full/html?skipTracking=true) tracing the history of the thin blue line flag by Maurice Chammah and Cary Aspinwall of the Marshall Project, the idea of a thin blue line was first used to describe police in the United States in the 1920s and was popularized in the 1950s by Los Angeles Police Chief William H. Parker. 

It is worth noting that according to Chammah and Aspinwall, Parker was also notorious for making racist remarks. In summary, the origin of the thin blue line as a concept lies in the idea that the police separate ordered society from the chaos of a criminal element, and the idea was popularized by a police chief who was overtly racist. It would be naïve to assert that Parker’s racism and his promotion of a policing philosophy that divides society into an “us” deserving protection and a “them” that does not, are unconnected.

Dr. Brian Kingshott wrote an article titled. [Police Culture, Ethics and Entitlement Theory](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/police_entitlement_theory.pdf), where he described the police culture as isolationist, elitist, misogynist, racist, and authoritarian. Kingshott suggests that these cultural descriptions stem from everyday interactions of the police with their various environments, and the people they meet in those environments. Those environments include other agencies, (medical response teams, courts, lawyers, probation, social services, employment
agencies, customs, corrections, immigration, etc.), accident and crime scenes, victims home and work place, the organizations managers and day to day social intercourse
with the general public.


#### Origin of Blue Lives Matter

The "Blue Lives Matter" movement was created in December 2014 in the wake of the homicides of Eric Garner and Michael Brown Jr earlier that year and in the context of the greater Black Lives Matter movement.  There isn't a "blue" race making this movement to be against the Black Lives Matter movement.

In August 2021 the village board of Mount Prospect, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, voted to remove the thin blue line flag patch from police officers' uniforms. The police chief had stated that the symbol was intended as "a memorial to police officers killed serving their community". However, one trustee noted that ["this patch is considered racist by many regardless of what the intent is"](https://patch.com/illinois/arlingtonheights/thin-blue-line-flags-removed-mount-prospect-police-uniforms).

Without considering its racist origin, the thin blue line mentality is counterproductive to effective policing. Criminals do not exist as an element separate from society, they exist within it, and like all of citizens, hold multifaceted identities. Reducing a human being to a label, to a criminal, makes it easier to wage war against them (or lock them away), but harder to recognize and address the forces within society that promotes criminal behavior. The thin blue line mentality makes law enforcement about punishing criminals, rather than promoting the wellbeing of society.
