Many police officers do not understand the laws they are enforcing and often make mistakes which lead the civil rights violations.  

#### Ignorance of the law

It is the utmost duty of every person connected with the affairs of court to know the law.  Many civilians without professional or specialized knowledge are acquainted with the laws and regulations. 

Being an imperative component of the judicial system, law enforcement officers are unaware of the laws and procedures: it is a case of ignorance.  Officers are held liable for their negligence and lack of awareness.

Ignorance of the law is ordinarily not an excuse for criminal law violations, except when a person makes a mistake of law because of a reasonable reliance upon an official interpretation of the law. 

#### Heien v. North Carolina

In the case of Heien v. North Carolina, the court created a mistake of law defense based upon an officer’s ignorance of the law, which carved out a new exception to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. 

An article, [Police Ignorance And Mistake Of Law Under The Fourth Amendment](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/ngov_police_ignorance.pdf), published by Eang L. Ngov from Stanford Journal of Civil Rights & Civil Liberties (SJCRCL), analyzes five ways in which the Court's mistake of law analogy in the Fourth Amendment context is incongruous with the criminal law mistake of law defense.

In Heien, an officer’s ignorance of the law caused them to stop a car based on his mistaken belief that the defendant had violated the requirement for two working brake lights. 

Even though the officer was wrong about the law, Heien held that an officer's reasonable mistake of law may support reasonable articulable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop. 

---

Consequently, the evidence obtained as a result of the stop was admissible. By importing the mistake of law defense from criminal law to allow for police ignorance, Heien represents a significant departure from the Court's good faith exception jurisprudence, which was previously justified on reasonable reliance. Moreover, it contradicts criminal law's application of and policies underlying the mistake of law defense.

One disconcerting implication of Heien's insulation of ad hoc decisions is that validating an officer's stop based on a mistaken understanding of the law will subject citizens to increased pretextual stops and racial profiling. 

Given past patterns of racial disparity in law enforcement contact with the public, the concerns are neither imaginary nor unfounded. 

Research on traffic stops reveals that a disproportionate number of non-white motorists are stopped and searched. 

---

The Bureau for Justice Statistics, through its Police-Public Contact Survey, made the following findings concerning traffic stops in 2011:

* An estimated 26.4 million persons age 16 or older indicated that their most recent contact with the police in 2011 was as a driver pulled over in a traffic stop. These drivers represented 12% of the nation’s 212 million drivers.

* A greater percentage of male drivers (12%) than female drivers (8%) were stopped by police during 2011. A higher percentage of black drivers (13%) than white (10%) and Hispanic (10%) drivers were stopped by police during 2011.

* Stopped drivers reported speeding as the most common reason for being pulled over in 2011.

* Approximately 80% of drivers pulled over by police in 2011 felt they had been stopped for a legitimate reason. In 2011, about 68% of black drivers believed police had a legitimate reason for stopping them compared to 84% of white and 74% of Hispanic drivers.

* In 2011, about 3% of traffic stops led to a search of the driver, the vehicle, or both. Police were more likely to search male drivers (4%) than female drivers (2%).

* A lower percentage of white drivers stopped by police in 2011 were searched (2%) than black (6%) or Hispanic (7%) drivers.

> * "Additionally, one report showed that among individuals who were subjected to traffic stops in New Jersey, 77.2 percent were African-American or Hispanic."

---

> * "In another study, Stanford researchers analyzed "4.5 million traffic stops in 100 North Carolina cities" and found a higher prevalence of police searching black and Hispanic drivers than white or Asian drivers."

---

> * "Although the study showed a correlation between the level of officers' suspicion and the driver's race — that officers used a lower threshold of suspicion to search black and Hispanic drivers — the researchers were cautious not to draw a causal connection."

#### the 5 CONSEQUENCES OF HEIEN’S INCONGRUOUS ANALOGY

*  Disincentives for Improvement Through Acquiring Knowledge

    One consequence of Heien's importation of the criminal law mistake of law doctrine into the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule context is that it creates a disincentive for officers to learn the law. 
    
    This will lead to more constitutional violations. 
  
    The mistake of law doctrine has been justified as a means of encouraging public awareness and legal knowledge.  
    
    Out of this is where [First Amendment Auditors](/resources/what-is-a-first-amendment-auditor), citizens that film officers doing traffic stops, and sometimes intervening the police come into play. 

    Heien's allowance of police ignorance to exempt evidence from exclusion provides no motivation for officers to know the law. 
    
    As Heien illustrates, a law enforcement officer need only have a vague notion of what a law means, for he can always fall back on the mistake of law defense to excuse their failure to actually learn the law.

*  Fraudulent Claims of Mistake

    A second problem caused by Heien's contorted analogy is that it will lead law enforement officers to make fraudulent claims of mistake. 
  
    Another justification for the common law mistake of law doctrine rested on the concern over fraudulent claims of mistake as evidence of a perceived culture of widespread perjury was also discovered when researchers interviewed Chicago judges, prosecutors, officers, and police chiefs. 

    ---

    In that study, researchers found that 95% of police and 97% of judges, public defenders, and prosecutors believed that police officers committed perjury to avoid the exclusion of evidence.  
    
    In another study, Chicago officers agreed that there was a perception of perjury even within the police department itself, conceding that officers "shade the facts a little (or a lot) to establish probable cause when there may not have been probable cause in fact.  
    
    Moreover, judges who believed the searches were illegal failed to suppress the evidence.

* Underdeterrence of Police Illegality

    In addition to creating a disincentive for knowing the law and facilitating false mistake claims, Heien will cause underdeterrence of illegal police conduct. 
    
    A recurring theme in the Court's mistake of law jurisprudence is the concern that exclusion of evidence will result in overdeterrence of conscientious police work.

    In the study of [Suspect Searches: Assessing Police Behavior Under the U.S. Constitution](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/pol-const.pdf), researchers observed that 30% of officers took part in directly illegal searches.

    ### CONSTITUTIONALITY OF POLICE SEARCHES

    <PoliceSearchesChart />

    Searches in Middleberg were relatively infrequent should not obscure the finding about the constitutionality of those searches. 
    
    30% of the 115 suspects in this sample were searched unconstitutionally.
  
    This data presents these estimates across the ten-point constitutionality scale, reflecting ordinal data (with equal-appearing intervals) for those searches in which the observed officers had responsibility for the search.
  
    The reseach of this data is confident about the classification of cases judged to be constitutional than those judged unconstitutional, which is but more proof of the benefit of the doubt we gave officers when assessing their behavior.
    
    Thus, if anything, this data concludes about constitutional violations are conservative estimates. 

    ---

    A search was more likely to be unconstitutional when suspects were released than when they were arrested or cited. 44% percent of released suspects were searched unconstitutionally, whereas only 7% of
    arrested / cited suspects experienced unconstitutional searches.  To be sure, some of this difference reflects the fact that many of the searches in the sample were those incident to arrest.

    ### CONSTITUTIONALITY OF POLICE SEARCHES BY ARREST OR CITATION (EXCLUDING SEARCHES INCIDENT TO ARRESTOR CITATION)

    <PoliceSearchByArrest />

    Removing these searches from the analysis produces the same conclusion. Indeed, 31 of the 34 unconstitutional searches would never reach the courts' view because suspects were neither cited nor taken into custody. 
  
    Even among the 45 defendants formally charged, only 10 generated evidence, and just 1 of these was coded unconstitutional (no shown here), meaning that only 3% of the unconstitutionally searched defendants would have had good cause to file a suppression motion. 
  
    Although other researchers have noted that suppression motions are filed in a relatively small number of cases, 13 of this data suggest that these cases miss the much *wider set of unconstitutional searches*. 

    ### CONSTITUTIONALITY OF POLICE SEARCHES BY INTRUSIVENESS OF SEARCH 

    <PoliceSearchByIntrusive />

    The Middleberg data contain observations of both full searches and frisks or pat-down searches. The latter are comparable with the searches examined by the New York Attorney General's Office. 
  
    According to that study, 14% of frisks by the New York Police Department were unconstitutional when examining officers' explanations for their conduct (Civil Rights Bureau, 1999). Using direct observation, the results from Middleberg suggest a higher rate of illegality; 46% of pat-down searches were unconstitutional. 
  
    The data above reflects a rate more than double that of the 20% of full searches that were illegal!

    Some officers admitted that they engaged in aggressive tactics involving intentional illegality to seize the contraband for confiscation rather than because of a genuine misunderstanding of the law.  Below are interactive charts from this study focusing on frequency of unconstitutional searches.

* Potential for Abuse: Racial Profiling and Pretextual Stops

    Research shows that officers avoid warrants and seek out other informal methods to further their investigation.
    
    Researchers for the National Center for State Courts studied the efficacy of warrant searches in obtaining evidence particularized in the warrant.
    
    As part of the study, researchers interviewed law enforcement officers regarding their approaches and evaluations of warrants and the warrant process.
  
    Heien provides another opportunity for police officers to engage in pretextual or racial profiling - through the guise of being mistaken about the law.

    ---
  
    [Living with Leon](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/living_with_leon.pdf), by Donald Drippst, noted that "delay and inconvenience were widely cited as the principal basis for officers' reluctance to seek a search warrant."  For example, one detective remarked, 
  
    > * "You see, search warrants are double the time, sometimes triple the time that you take on arrest warrants, and arrest warrants are long enough. Arrest warrants, you figure a half a day."

    As a result, officers seek out informal avenues to conduct searches in order to obtain evidence. As one officer candidly admitted:

    > * "Actually, there are a lot of warrants that are not sought because of the hassle. You just figure it’s not worth the hassle... I don't think you can forego a case because of the hassle of a search warrant, but you can... work some other method. If I can get consent to search, I'm gonna do it."

    ---

    Similarly, [Search Warrant Process - Preconceptions, Perceptions, and Practices - An Executive Summary](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/search_warrant_process.pdf) reported a low rate for search warrants and the relative ease of officers obtaining consent.  
    
    The revelations about police preferences for informal processes - warrantless searches—might not be surprising, but they contribute to a troubling picture that may develop about the consequences of Heien. 
  
    Since officers are already prone to resort to informal processes (i.e., through warrantless searches), Heien compounds the problem because it insulates ad hoc decisions that officers make on the scene, including those based on a mistake of law.

    ---

    This report also displays similar conversations with law enforcement officers that lead to the conclusion that consent is the easiest thing in the world to obtain.  
    
    One Mountain City detective explained, you make an offer that cannot be refused:

  > * "You tell the guy, Let me come in and take a look at your house.  And then he says 'no, I don't want to.'  Then you tell him,"
  
  ---
  
  > * "Then, I'm going to leave Sam here, and he's going to live with you until we come back with the search warrant.  Now we can do it either way.  And very rarely do the people say 'Go get your search warrant then.'"
   
    ---

   > * "Consent to a search must be voluntarily given, and not the result of duress or coercion, express or implied."

    A judge commented saying:

    > * "The very fact that you've got three 250 pound guys standing there with badges and guns on means the person isn't going to say 'No.'"

    In other words, some situations get dangerously close to being inherently coercive.  
  
    A vast number of officers apprised in the research report that another effective way to avoid the hassle of getting a search warrant was to execute an arrest at a time the suspect is likely to have the sought-for evidence within the area of immediate control. 
  
    These items can then be seized, incident to the arrest:

    > * "It depends on what you're looking for... If you think it's going to be in the car, you'd like to arrest the guy in the car, because then you've got the car. You can do an inventory search of the car; you can have it impounded.  If you get him at home, you are kind of precluded from d"oing too much."
  
    ---

    > * "I mean, you go in and you arrest him, and you start going through bed linen and stuff like that, you know you're going to be thrown out of court. It comes down to just how important the piece of evidence is you're looking for."

    ---

    The [research](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/search_warrant_process.pdf) also suggests search warrants are sought in relatively few investigations, but also, the number of law enforcement officers who seek warrants is quite limited. 
  
    The summary of interviews with law enforcement officials suggest that search warrants are primarily the province of detectives or officers assigned to specialized investigative units rather than of officers on routine patrol.  
  
    When a uniformed officer finds that a search which may need a warrant is called for, the usual practice is to call a supervisor or specialized investigation unit to obtain advice on whether a warrant is required, and if so, to obtain assistance in procuring one.

    ### Conceptual Model of the Search Warrant Process

* Procedural Fairness and Legitimacy

  Heien's application of the mistake of law defense in disregard of the doctrinal requirements and its inconsistent application of the exclusionary rule will diminish the public's regard for the criminal justice system's legitimacy and moral credibility. 

  The [study](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/pol-const.pdf) suggests that scholars have identified *legitimacy* and *moral credibility* as two important goals of the criminal justice system.  The reseach study cites [Perceptions of Fairness and Justice: The Shared Aims and Occasional Conflicts of Legitimacy and Moral Credibility](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/fairness_justice.pdf), which examines in depth, the shared aims and overlaps in operation and effect of these two criminal justice dynamics: 

  "legitimacy" that derives from fair adjudication and professional enforcement and the "moral credibility" that derives from just results, as well as the occasional potential for conflict. 

  ---

  Almost certainly, the police lose perceived legitimacy when they intentionally or willfully (or even recklessly or negligently) employ excessive force. This is a somewhat straightforward issue, and it
  need not detain us long. It goes without saying that, for any number of normative and instrumental reasons beyond perceptions of legitimacy, police should refrain from the kinds of abuses of power
  made infamous by the beating of Rodney King, the killing of Arthur McDuffie, the sodomizing of Abner Louima, the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Amir Locke, and [many more](/say-their-names).

  ---

  Under some circumstances, the most problematic forms of racial profiling may implicate the danger. Specifically, consider the example of an officer who stops and searches an individual after drawing
  unwarranted inferences of culpability based solely on skin color.  

  Imagine further that the officer employs a soft tone and exhibits a gentle demeanor.  

  For obvious reasons, courteousness is commendable, but the fear is that the officer may use polite words and kind manner to manipulate the subtler aspects of police to citizen interactions to create a false perception that they are not engaged in racial profiling, even when they are.

---

In short, one set of legitimate practices may mask others that potentially are illegitimate. To put differently, police may play professional and unprofessional practices off of one another. As Tyler and Wakslak found:

> * "Police behavior shapes the attributions people make... Those who believe that the police are neutral are less likely to feel profiled... Those who experience high quality
interpersonal treatment politeness, respect, acknowledgment of their rights - are also less likely to feel that they have been profiled."

---

> * This tendency of people to confuse respectful policing for unbiased policing may be good for police and even for public safety, particularly if profiling is a somewhat intractable product of unconscious motivation, but it is not categorically good to the degree we are committed to more than just normative crime control to the degree we care also about the fairness and equity of police procedures in reality. "

---

[Perceptions of Fairness and Justice](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/fairness_justice.pdf) dives into false positives:

> * "At a macro-level, the greatest risk of false positives undoubtedly arises out of corrupt governments that are erroneously perceived to be fair and just. An unjust society will perceive its unjust
procedures and rules to be just-even where these procedures and rules merely reproduce that society's backward worldview."

---

> * "Put differently, bankrupt intuitions may do nothing to check bankrupt institutions. To the extent that people buy into the illogic and injustice of, say, a fascist or racist system, such as Nazi Germany or the Jim Crow South-levels of deference remain unaffected (at least among the unsubordinated classes)."

#### Police being purposely ignorant of the law is a huge problem

From making up laws to failure to interpret the law, the entire role of law enforcement comes into question.  As [Police Ignorance And Mistake Of Law Under The Fourth Amendment](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/ngov_police_ignorance.pdf) explains under Disincentives for Improvement Through Acquiring Knowledge - 

the consequences of Heien's criminal law mistake of law doctrine into the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule context is that it creates discouragement for officers to learn the law, improve their knowledge, or have advanced knowledge of law.  

The typical police officer responding with "You're going to jail now, we'll figure everything else later." doesn't sit easy with citizens.  Unfortunately, Heien v. North Carolina allows law enforcement to be purposefully ignorant on law.
