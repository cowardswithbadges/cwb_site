Many police officers do not understand the laws they are enforcing and often make mistakes which lead the civil rights violations.  

#### Ignorance of the law

It is the utmost duty of every person connected with the affairs of court to know the law.  Many civilians without professional or specialized knowledge are acquainted with the laws and regulations. Being an imperative component of the judicial system, law enforcement officers are unaware of the laws and procedures: it is a case of ignorance.  Officers are held liable for their negligence and lack of awareness.

Ignorance of the law is ordinarily not an excuse for criminal law violations,
except when a person makes a mistake of law because of a reasonable reliance
upon an official interpretation of the law. 

#### Heien v. North Carolina

In the case of Heien v. North Carolina, the court created a mistake of law defense based upon an officer’s ignorance of the law, which
carved out a new exception to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. 

An article. [Police Ignorance And Mistake Of Law Under The Fourth Amendment](https://dfde.net), published by Eang L. Ngov from Stanford Journal of Civil Rights & Civil Liberties (SJCRCL), analyzes five ways in which the Court's mistake of law analogy in the Fourth Amendment context is incongruous with the criminal law mistake of law defense.

In Heien, an officer’s ignorance of the law caused him to stop a car based on his mistaken belief that the defendant had violated the requirement for two working
brake lights. Even though the officer was wrong about the law, Heien held that an officer's reasonable mistake of law may support reasonable articulable suspicion
to justify an investigatory stop. 

Consequently, the evidence obtained as a result of the stop was admissible. By importing the mistake of law defense from criminal
law to allow for police ignorance, Heien represents a significant departure from
the Court's good faith exception jurisprudence, which was previously justified on
reasonable reliance. Moreover, it contradicts criminal law's application of and
policies underlying the mistake of law defense.
