#### Egosyntonic vs. Egodystonic

In psychoanalysis, egosyntonic refers to the behaviors, values, and feelings that are in harmony with or acceptable to the needs and goals of the ego, or consistent with one's ideal self-image. 

Egodystonic (or ego alien) is the opposite, referring to thoughts and behaviors (dreams, compulsions, desires, etc.) that are in conflict, or dissonant, with the needs and goals of the ego, or, further, in conflict with a person's ideal self-image.

#### Taking care of your mental health is part of life

Take for instance, an Olympian, Simone Biles.  She disclosed her mental health struggles during the Tokyo Olympics, says she's 

> * "still scared to do gymnastics."

Simone Biles described her ongoing struggles with performing gymnastics routines in the wake of her bout with "the twisties" - that caused her to withdraw from multiple events in the Tokyo Olympics in the summer of 2020.

Imagine flying through the air and springing off a piece of equipment as you prepare to flip on one axis while twisting on another. It all happens fast, so there’s a small window of time to adjust. You rely on muscle memory, trusting that it will work out because with so much practice, it usually does.

The twisties is defined as when a gymnastics athelte is suddenly upside down in midair and their brain feels disconnected from their body. Their limbs that usually control how much you spin have stopped listening, and they feel lost awhile in the air. They hope all the years spent in this sport will guide their body to a safe landing position.  When Simone Biles pushed off the vaulting table in the Tokyo Olympics, she entered that terrifying world of uncertainty. In the Olympic team final, Biles planned to perform a 2½ twisting vault, but her mind chose to stall after just 1½ twists.

> * "To do something that I’ve done forever and just not be able to do it because of everything I’ve gone through is really crazy because I love this sport so much.  It's hard. I'm sorry. And I don’t think people understand the magnitude of what I go through, but for so many years to go through everything that I’ve gone through having a front, I'm proud of myself."

Biles cited mental health issues that triggered the twisties, a disorientation in the air while she was competing, as the reason for her stunning withdrawal from multiple events in Tokyo after entering as a heavy favorite to win several gold medals.

#### Saying you're not racist is not enough - be anti-racist

* Acknowledge Modern Day Racism Exists

  Most people assume that anti-discrimination laws have eliminated racism from society, studies show that this isn’t the case.  Ethnic minorities still experience a great deal of prejudice and discrimination. Studies have found that minorities are:

  * Less likely to receive adequate care from physicians. [Reducing Racial Inequities in Health: Using What We Already Know to Take Action](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/racial_inequities_health.pdf) - found that between 1993 and 2012, among children aged 5 to 11 years, the overall suicide rate for this age group was stable, obscuring that while the rate had declined for whites and was stable for Hispanics and other racial groups, it had almost doubled for blacks 

  * Less likely to receive employment offers.  One of the remarkable findings from [Identifying Discrimination at Work: The Use of Field Experiments](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/discrimination_work.pdf) study is the consistency of Black - White disparities across the two cities suggests that racial discrimination in hiring is not the product of distinctive local cultures or labor market dynamics but rather a more generalized phenomenon.

  * Judged more harshly for crimes they commit.  The United States Sentencing Commission released a report on [Demographic Differences in Sentencing](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/sentence_demographics.pdf) and one of the key findings is black male offenders continued to receive longer sentences than similarly situated White male offenders.

  * More likely to be shot by police officers.  The results from [Deaths Due to Use of Lethal Force by Law Enforcement](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/deaths_by_law_enforcement.pdf) study where data from the National Violent Death
  Reporting System found that victims were majority white (52%) but disproportionately black (32%) with a fatality rate 2.8 times higher among blacks than whites. 
  
    Most victims were reported to be armed (83%); however, black victims were more likely to be unarmed (14.8%) than white (9.4%) or Hispanic (5.8%) victims. Fatality rates among military veterans/active duty service members were 1.4 times greater than among their civilian counterparts. Four case subtypes were examined based on themes that emerged in incident narratives: about 22% of cases were mental health related; 18% were suspected "suicide by cop" incidents, with white victims more likely than black or Hispanic victims to die in these circumstances; 
  
    14% involved intimate partner violence; and about 6% were unintentional deaths due to LE action. Another 53% of cases were unclassified and did not fall into a coded subtype.  Regression analyses identified victim and incident characteristics associated with each case subtype
    and unclassified cases.
  
  * Treated with more suspicion in public places. 


*  Recognize Your Prejudice.  

  For example, if you say, "I'd never do anything racist,” you may want to dig deeper and take a closer look at yourself. The research study [Personality and Individual Differences: Prejudiced And Unaware Of It](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/prejudiced_unaware.pdf) shows that participants overestimated their levels of racial and gender-based egalitarianism, and this pattern was strongest among the most prejudiced participants. 

  Perspectives on Psychological Science wrote an article titled [Whites See Racism as a Zero-Sum Game That They Are Now Losing](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/white_zero_sum_game.pdf), which found that Blacks over the past six decades are associated with increases in perceived bias against Whites — a relationship not observed in Blacks’ perceptions. Moreover, these changes in Whites’ conceptions of racism are extreme enough that Whites have now come to view anti-White bias as a bigger societal problem than anti-Black bias.


*  Discover Yourself. 

  Contratry to popular belief, you might think your anti-racism journey should start with learning about other races and cultures. However, developing more self-awareness first can be key to helping you gain insight into your beliefs.  [Intercultural competence through cultural self-study: A strategy for adult learners](https://cowards-with-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/intercultural_competence.pdf) found that individuals can become more culturally competent by exploring their own historical roots and values.  
  
  Developing a better understanding of your ancestors and their experiences, and thinking about how your family functions as a group, can help you see the ways these have impacted you. It can make you more aware of your own biases while sparking curiosity about other cultures and races.

  In Sonya Renee Taylor's book titled, [The Body Is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Not-Apology-Radical-Self-Love/dp/1626569762) promotes the concept of radical self-love, which involves loving your body and your whole authentic self. She believes that part of the root of biases we have stems from personal shortcomings. By learning to accept ourselves more authentically, improvements as a society can be made.


* Discover Others.

  Educate yourself about other races, cultures, and religions. Learn about the history of racism and discrimination.  Strive to learn more about what other people are experiencing today.

  Use [Justice in June](https://justiceinjune.org/), a resource was compiled by Autumn Gupta with Bryanna Wallace's oversight for the purpose of providing a starting place for individuals trying to become better allies.  Spend 10, 25, or 45 minutes a day building awareness and become an active ally to the black community.

  Read books and watch, tv shows, and movies created by people of color to gain different perspectives from other races and cultures.  The subject of this content can be scientific to fiction.

  Look for news from a variety of sources. Watching the same news channel, reading articles from the same website, and/or listening to the same podcast only gives you one perspective. Learn from many different people, and you’ll see there are other ways to tell the same story.

* Interact With People of Different Races

  There's no substitute for first-hand experience. Talking to people who are different from you, working with people of other races, and interacting with them in all sorts of circumstances can help you gain the most insight.

  You will gain a great deal of knowledge when you listen to people. But don’t ask them to educate you on racism. Essentially trying to explain their daily experiences - places a burden on them.

* Educate yourself by Enrolling in courses.

  A 2001 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that students who were enrolled in a prejudice and conflict seminar showed significantly reduced implicit and explicit anti-Black biases compared with the control group.

  This study shows that biases can be changed—even the ones that seem automatic. Learning about your stereotypes can significantly reduce your levels of prejudice. A more recent 2012 study also supports these findings, suggesting that anti-prejudice training and intervention could lead to significant long-term reductions in implicit race bias.

    * Educate yourself with [Anti-racism Resources for White People](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRlF2_zhNe86SGgHa6-VlBO-QgirITwCTugSfKie5Fs/edit)

    * Read content designed to educate and inform people about racial issues.

    * Read the wealth of [independent scholars](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=online+diversity+and+inclusion+training&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart) that have articles, studies, and courses available.

    * Local libraries also often have book clubs and programs designed to promote diversity and racial understanding.
